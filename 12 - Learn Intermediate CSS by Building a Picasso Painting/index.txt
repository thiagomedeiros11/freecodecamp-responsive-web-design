Step 1

Start by setting up your HTML structure. Add a <!DOCTYPE> declaration and an html element with a lang attribute set to en. Within the html element, add a head element and a body element.


Step 2

Within your head element, add a meta tag with the charset attribute set to utf-8. Also add a title element with the text Picasso Painting.


Step 3

Go ahead and link your CSS file now, even though you have not written any CSS yet.

Add a link element with a rel of stylesheet and an href of styles.css.


Step 4

FontAwesome is a library of SVG-powered icons, many of which are freely available to use. You will be using some of these icons in this project, so you will need to link the external stylesheet to your HTML.

Add a link element with a rel of stylesheet and an href of https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css.


Step 5

To get your painting started, give your body element a background-color of rgb(184, 132, 46).


Step 6

Within your body tag, add a div element. Give it an id of back-wall.


Step 7

Use an id selector to give the element with the id back-wall a background-color of #8B4513.


Step 8

Give the #back-wall element a width of 100% and a height of 60%.


Step 9

Typically, HTML is rendered in a top-down manner. Elements at the top of the code are positioned at the top of the page. However, many times you may want to move the elements to different positions. You can do this with the position property.

Set the position property for the #back-wall element to absolute. An absolute position takes the element out of that top-down document flow and allows you to adjust it relative to its container.

When an element is manually positioned, you can shift its layout with top, left, right, and bottom. Set the #back-wall element to have a top value of 0, and a left value of 0.


Step 10

The z-index property is used to create "layers" for your HTML elements. If you are familiar with image editing tools, you may have worked with layers before. This is a similar concept.

Elements with a higher z-index value will appear to be layered on top of elements with a lower z-index value. This can be combined with the positioning in the previous lesson to create unique effects.

Since the back-wall element will need to appear "behind" the other elements you will be creating, give the back-wall element a z-index of -1.


Step 11

Below your #back-wall element, create a div with a class of characters. This is where you will be creating your painting's characters.


Step 12

Inside that .characters element, create another div with an id of offwhite-character.


Step 13

Create four div elements inside your offwhite-character element. Give those div elements the following id values, in order: white-hat, black-mask, gray-instrument, tan-table.


Step 14

This character needs eyes. Create two div elements in the #black-mask element. Give them the classes eyes left and eyes right, in that order.


Step 16

Using an id selector, create a rule for the element with the id offwhite-character. Give it a width of 300px, a height of 550px, and a background-color of GhostWhite.


Step 17

Move the #offwhite-character into place by giving it a position of absolute, a top value of 20%, and a left value of 17.5%.


Step 18

Using an id selector, style the element with the id white-hat. Give it a width and height of 0, and a border-style of solid.


Step 19

That does not look quite right. Set a border-width of 0 120px 140px 180px to size the hat properly.


Step 20

Now you have a large box. Give it a border-top-color, border-right-color, and border-left-color of transparent. Set the border-bottom-color to GhostWhite. This will make it look more like a hat.


Step 21

Give the hat a position of absolute, a top value of -140px, and a left value of 0.


Step 22

Using an id selector, create a rule for the element with the id black-mask. Give it a width of 100%, a height of 50px, and a background-color of rgb(45, 31, 19).


Step 23

Give the mask a position of absolute, and a top and left value of 0.


Step 24

To ensure you can see the mask, give it a z-index of 1.


Step 25

Using an id selector, give the element with the id gray-instrument a width of 15%, a height of 40%, and a background-color of rgb(167, 162, 117).


Step 26

Now move it into place with a position of absolute, a top value of 50px, and a left value of 125px.


Step 27

Set the z-index to 1.


Step 28

Use a class selector to create a rule for the elements with black-dot class. Set the width to 10px, the height to 10px, and the background-color to rgb(45, 31, 19).


Step 29

These dots are just a little too square. Give the black-dot class a border-radius of 50% to fix it.


Step 30

Move the dots into place by setting the display to block, the margin to auto, and the margin-top to 65%.


Step 31

Use an id selector to style the element with the id tan-table. Give it a width of 450px, a height of 140px, and a background-color of #D2691E.


Step 32

Move the table into place by giving it a position of absolute, a top value of 275px, and a left value of 15px.


Step 33

Give the table a z-index of 1.


Step 34

After your div#offwhite-character element, add a div with the id of black-character.


Step 35

Within your new #black-character element, add three div elements with the following id values, in order: black-hat, gray-mask, white-paper.


Step 36

The mask needs eyes. Within your #gray-mask element, add two div elements. The first should have the class set to eyes left, and the second should have the class set to eyes right.


Step 37

Time to use some FontAwesome icons.

The i element is used for idiomatic text, or text that is separate from the "normal" text content. This could be for italic text, such as scientific terms, or for icons like those provided by FontAwesome.

Within your #white-paper element, add four i elements. Give them all a class value of fas fa-music.

This special class is how FontAwesome determines which icon to load. fas indicates the category of icons (FontAwesome Solid, here), while fa-music selects the specific icon.


Step 38

Use an id selector to create a rule for the element with the id black-character. Set the width to 300px, the height to 500px, and the background-color to rgb(45, 31, 19).


Step 39

Move the #black-character element into place by setting the position to absolute, the top to 30%, and the left to 59%.


Step 40

Use an id selector to create a rule for the element with the id black-hat. Give it a width of 0, a height of 0, and a border-style of solid.


Step 41

Set the border-width of the #black-hat to 150px 0 0 300px.


Step 42

Just like with your #white-hat, you should style the border for the #black-hat element. Give it a border-top-color, border-right-color, and border-bottom-color of transparent. Set the border-left-color to rgb(45, 31, 19).


Step 43

Now position the #black-hat element. Give it a position of absolute, with a top of -150px and a left of 0.


Step 44

Using an id selector, style the element with the id gray-mask. Give it a width of 150px, a height of 150px, and a background-color of rgb(167, 162, 117).


Step 45

Position the #gray-mask element by setting position to absolute, the top to -10px, and the left to 70px.


Step 46

Using an id selector, create a rule for the id white-paper. Set the width to 400px, the height to 100px, and the background-color to GhostWhite.


Step 47

Give the #white-paper a position of absolute, a top of 250px, and a left of -150px to move it into place.


Step 48

Set the z-index of the #white-paper element to 1.


Step 49

FontAwesome icons come with their own styling to define the icon. However, you can still set the styling yourself as well, to change things like the color and size. For now, use a class selector to target the icons with the class fa-music. Set the display to inline-block, the margin-top to 8%, and the margin-left to 13%.


Step 50

Below your #black-character element, add two new div elements. These will be the shawl. Give both of them a class of blue. Then give the first one an id of blue-left, and the second an id of blue-right.


Step 51

Use a class selector to target the new elements with the class blue. Set the background-color to #1E90FF.


Step 52

Select the element with the id blue-left using an id selector. Give it a width of 500px and a height of 300px.


Step 53

Now set the position to absolute, the top to 20%, and the left to 20%.


Step 54

Next, target the element with the id blue-right using an id selector. Set the width to 400px and the height to 300px.


Step 55

Give the #blue-right element the correct positioning with position set to absolute, top set to 50%, and left set to 40%.


Step 56

Below your .blue elements, add another div. Give it the id value of orange-character.


Step 57

Within that #orange-character element, add four div elements. Give them the id values of black-round-hat, eyes-div, triangles, and guitar, in order.


Step 58

The #eyes-div element should hold some eyes. Add two div elements inside. Give the first a class of eyes left, and give the second a class of eyes right.


Step 60

Within the #guitar element, create three div elements. Give the first two a class value of guitar. Then give the first an id of guitar-left, and the second an id of guitar-right. Add an id to the third div with the value guitar-neck.

The third div should not have the guitar class.


Step 61

Use another FontAwesome icon for your .guitar. Inside both the #guitar-left and #guitar-right elements, add an i element and give it a class of fas fa-bars.


Step 62

Select your orange-character element with an id selector. Give it a width of 250px, a height of 550px, and a background-color of rgb(240, 78, 42).


Step 63

Give the #orange-character element a position of absolute, a top of 25%, and a left of 40%.


Step 64

Style the element with the id black-round-hat using an id selector. Set the width to 180px, the height to 150px, and the background-color to rgb(45, 31, 19).


Step 65

The #black-round-hat element should probably be round. Give it a border-radius of 50% to fix this.


Step 66

Move the #black-round-hat element into place with a position of absolute, a top of -100px, and a left of 5px.


Step 67

Put the #black-round-hat element on the correct layer with a z-index of -1.


Step 68

Use an id selector to create a rule for the element with the id eyes-div. Set the width to 180px and the height to 50px.


Step 69

Now move the #eyes-div element into position with position set to absolute, top set to -40px, and left set to 20px.


Step 70

Give the #eyes-div element a z-index of 3.


Step 71

Target the element with the id triangles using an id selector. Set the width to 250px and the height to 550px.


Step 72

Create a class selector for the elements with the triangle class. Set the width to 0 and the height to 0.


Step 73

Style the border of your .triangle elements. Set the border-style to solid and the border-width to 42px 45px 45px 0.


Step 74

Give your .triangle elements the correct color. Set the border-top-color, border-bottom-color, and border-left-color to transparent. Set the border-right-color to Gold.


Step 75

Adjust the layout of the .triangle elements with a display of inline-block.


Step 76

Now use an id selector for guitar. Set the width to 100%, and the height to 100px.


Step 77

In the same #guitar selector, set the position to absolute, the top to 120px, and the left to 0px.


Step 78

Give the #guitar rule a z-index of 3.


Step 79

Now use a class selector to target guitar. This will style the two "halves" of your guitar. Set the width to 150px, the height to 120px, the background-color to Goldenrod, and the border-radius to 50%.


Step 80

Select the id with value guitar-left, and set the position to absolute and the left to 0px.


Step 81

Select the id with value guitar-right, and also set position to absolute. This time, set left to 100px.


Step 82

Now you need to move the bar icons into place. Create a class selector for the fa-bars class. Set the display to block, the margin-top to 30%, and the margin-left to 40%.


Step 83

Use an id selector to create a rule for the id guitar-neck. Set the width to 200px, the height to 30px, and the background-color to #D2691E.


Step 84

Now move the #guitar-neck element with a position of absolute, a top value of 45px, and a left value of 200px.


Step 85

Give the #guitar-neck element a z-index of 3.


Step 86

Time to style the elements with the eyes class. Use a class selector to set the width to 35px, the height to 20px, the background-color to #8B4513, and the border-radius to 20px 50%.


Step 87

Target the class with value right and set the position to absolute, top to 15px, and right to 30px.


Step 88

For the class with value left, create the selector and set the position to absolute, the top to 15px, and the left to 30px.


Step 89

One last step. The FontAwesome icons are a little too small. Target all of them with a class selector for fas, and set the font-size to 30px.

With that, your Picasso painting is complete!
